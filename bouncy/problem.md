Lets bounce around! Take the numbers given and find the next! Start at index 0. Each turn move to the index determined by the sum of the current index and the number contained in the current index. The game ends when you reach the index containing the number 0. You will always end on the index containing the number 0. To be clear, there will never be an infinite loop.
