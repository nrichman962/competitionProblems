# Soldier Count

Scout! We're under attack from both the East and West. I need you to flank around East and get a count of enemy numbers. I need to know exactly how many troops to commit on our side. Be careful though, the enemy may try to trick you with their numbers! They're getting cocky as well, for some reason they're all smiling!

In this problem you will need to make a program that gets the count of people in a line. A line will be designated by a string of characters, and a person consist of the characters ':' and ')' OR '(' and ':' sequentially.

For example, :):) is a line that contains two units, the line (:)) also contains two, and the line ):(): does not contain any.

## Input

The first input will be the number of lines to examine. Each line after that will be a line of units.

## Output

Output a number corresponding to the amount of smiley faces in one line.
