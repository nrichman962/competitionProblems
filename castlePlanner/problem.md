# Castle Planner

You are the greatest city planner this kingdom has ever known. Everyone entrusts that your castles will stand throughout all monster attacks. Your secret? Long hours of research on the various monsters in an area. 
By studying any potential attackers, you can find just how high they can jump, how long they can climb, and build your walls tall enough for safety! At this point you've surely done enough research, so you must tell the builders how tall to make the new castle walls!

In this problem you will need to make a program that takes a number N representing the height of a monster. To make the wall tall enough, you must add every positive natural even number that is less than or equal to N. 

Note: If you are given an odd number that number is not added to the final answer.
For example, 4 and 5 will have the same solution of 2 + 4 = 6.


## Input

The first input will be the number of castles to plan. Each number after that will be a monster height, N.

## Output

The output will be the summation of all even numbers <=N.
