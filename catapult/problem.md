The orcs are beginning their assault on Minas Tirith. However, their ballistics tables were destroyed
in a brawl. You, their last human prisoner, must help them accurately fire their catapults or face a
grisly fate.

A given catapult always releases its projectiles at the same angle. To target a given position, the
orcs must adjust the amount of force the catapult imparts to he ammunition. Once in the air, the
projectile follows a ballistic trajectory and is large enough that the effects due to air resistance
are negligible. The acceleration due to gravity on the battlefield is exactly 9.81m/s^2.

## Input

Each line will contain the release angle in degrees from horizontal, the target distance in meters,
and the target elevation in meters.

## Output

Print the case number followed by the release velocity in meters per second rounded to two decimal
places.
