# FizzBuzz
According to Wikipedia, FizzBuzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. This may or may not be true, but this exercise is often used to ~~torture~~ screen young computer science graduates during programming interviews. Basically, this is how it works: you print the integers from 1 to N, replacing any of them divisible by X with Fizz or, if they are divisible by Y, with Buzz. If the number is divisible by both X and Y, you print FizzBuzz instead. Check the samples for further clarification.


# Input
There may be multiple cases to display. Each test case will contain three integers on a single line: X, Y and N (1 <= X < Y <= N <= 100). The last case is followed by a line containing 0 0 0.

# Output
For each case, display the case number followed by the solution, formatted as in the sample. Print integers from 1 to N in order, each on its own line, replacing the ones divisible by X with Fizz, the ones divisible by Y with Buzz and ones divisible by both X and Y with FizzBuzz.
